			<p class="title2">Summary</p> 
			<p class="bodyText">
					I have over 10 years of experience designing software in a complex and demanding environment.
					I take pride in the creation of highly usable and effective interfaces.
					I have designed many experiences ranging from workflow frameworks to advanced search tools to highly interactive data visualisations.
					<br><br>
					It is my belief that great software comes from a deep understanding of user's goals and the environment in which they work.
					Once an understanding is created I'll use a variety of techniques to explore the solution space, prototype and evaluate.
					I have very strong Axure skills, having built some very sophisticated prototypes, but I'm happy using Balsamiq or Javascript too.
					<br><br>
					The software systems I've designed meet the needs of several personas in a customer base spanning four major verticals.
					I have worked with teams using Agile and Waterfall methodologies, in large teams and alone.					 
					<br><br>
					I can contribute both creative problem solving skills along with an engineering discipline to writing specifications where appropriate.

			<p class="bodyText" > IBM, Senior UX Designer</p> 
			<p class="bodyText" > May 2012 - present</p>	

			<p class="bodyText"  >
				i2 was acquired by IBM in 2012 for a reported $500M. 
				Integration into IBM has resulted in a greater focus on enterprise software, internet technologies and web design conventions.
				I've also had the opportunity to work within a much wider design community.
				Recently IBM have embarked on a transformational project to recapture their reputation for design excellence. 
				I've been a champion for adopting this within the Cambridge site.
				
				<br><br>
				Highlights: 
				<br>
				<ul class="bodyText" style="margin-left:80px; margin-right:80px;margin-top:20px">
				<li>The design of an innovative data visualisation for the exploration of activity data, such as telephone call records </li>
				<li>Creation of a set of Design Principles to guide a new generation of software</li>
				<li>Designing the integration of the Next Generation platform with the legacy product set</li>
				<li>Scenario mapping, empathy mapping and persona creation for a range of enterprise customers</li>

			<p class=" "  >
				I was at the heart of the transformation of the flagship product into a powerful network graph analysis tool. 
				<br><br>
				
				Highlights: 
				<br>
				<ul class="bodyText">
				<li>The design of a new data transformation tool allow users to easily import data from a variety of formats </li>
				<li>Working with four graphic designer agencies to replace over 400 icons, I created a detailed brief and reviewed all work for consistency</li>
				<li>The addition of a Social Networking Analysis module and associated visualisations. </li>
				<li>A histogram and filtering tool which allows facet based exploration of the user's data, an innovative feature was the inclusion of algorithms to 
				scan all possible facets looking for particularly interesting attributes to suggest those for the user to explore.</li>
				</ul>

			<p class="bodyText" > May 1998 - June 2006</p>	
			<p class="bodyText" >
				I joined i2 as a Software Developer and worked my way to become a lead developer on the flagship product and then Development Manager leading a team of 20.
				During this time I was also increasingly involved in the design of the software.
				When User Experience started to be recognised as a speciality I made a case for setting up small design team which I would lead.
				This resulted in a greater consistency across the product range and a greater focus on user goals.		</p>
